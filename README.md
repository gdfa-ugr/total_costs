Total costs
===============

An open-access numerical tool for calculating the probability distribution function of the total costs for any type of protective maritime structure at any location during its life-time cycle follow the guidelines of the latest version of the ROM program is presented in this repository. The definition of the total costs is defined at first as the sum of the execution costs of construction, dismantling, and repair works as well as the costs of exploitation during the operating phase. The main variables that modify these costs, most of them of stochastic nature are: (i) the forcing agents, (ii) the design of the structure, (iii) the project factors, (iv) the organization and work planning definition including the decision and actions (strategies) taking during the life cycle, (v) the interactions between the former elements, and (vi) the useful life-time.
